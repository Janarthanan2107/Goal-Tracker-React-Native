# Creating and Deploying an Expo App with React Native

This guide will assist you in creating an Expo app using React Native and deploying it using the EAS (Expo Application Services) CLI.

## Creating a Project with Expo

1. To create a new project, run the following command:
   ```
   npx create-expo-app <projectName>
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to set up your project.

## Running the App Locally

1. Once your project is set up, navigate to its directory:
   ```
   cd <projectName>
   ```

2. To start the development server, run:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. This will open the Expo developer tools in your default web browser. From there, you can run your app in an iOS or Android simulator, or scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device to run it directly on your device.

## Deploying the Application

1. Install the EAS CLI globally by running:
   ```
   npm install -g eas-cli
   ```

2. Log in to your Expo account using EAS CLI:
   ```
   eas login
   ```
   Follow the prompts and enter your Expo username and password.

3. After logging in, configure the build settings for your project:
   ```
   eas build:configure
   ```

4. To initiate the build process, run:
   ```
   eas build -p android --profile preview
   ```
   Replace `-p android` with `-p ios` if you're deploying for iOS.

5. Follow the instructions provided by EAS CLI to complete the build process.
